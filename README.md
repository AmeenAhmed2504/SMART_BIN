SMART BIN Project

Introduction
The SMART BIN project aims to develop a smart dustbin to address increasing environmental and hygiene concerns due to population growth and increased waste production. The smart dustbin offers contactless waste disposal, promoting better hygiene and reducing the spread of viruses.

Objectives
Develop a smart dustbin that operates automatically.
Use ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of waste and open the lid without contact.
Enhance public hygiene and cleanliness, especially during pandemic situations.

Components
Arduino UNO: Microcontroller for the system.
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects proximity of objects to trigger the lid mechanism.
Servo Motor: Controls the automatic opening and closing of the dustbin lid.
Battery: Provides power to the system.
Jumper Wires & Breadboard: For connections and prototyping.

Functionality
The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of an object (e.g., a person's hand or waste) near the dustbin.
When detection occurs, the servo motor activates, opening the dustbin lid automatically.
The lid remains open for a predefined period, allowing waste to be disposed of without physical contact.
After the set period, the lid automatically closes.

Benefits
Reduces the need for physical contact, minimizing the risk of contamination and virus transmission.
Promotes hygiene and cleanliness in public and private spaces.
Suitable for various applications, including homes, offices, public areas, and healthcare facilities.

Future Enhancements
Integrating a waste level detection system to alert when the bin is full.
Implementing solar power for sustainable energy use.
Adding IoT capabilities for real-time monitoring and management.

Installation and Usage
Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino UNO board using the Arduino IDE.
Power the system with a 9V battery or suitable power source.
Place the smart dustbin in the desired location for contactless waste disposal.
